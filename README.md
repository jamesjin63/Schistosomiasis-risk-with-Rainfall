# Schistosomiasis-risk-with-Rainfall
Using rainfall to predict the Sch risk levels

We are using the China rainfall data, which predict the 10 days rainfall.
and our schistosomiasis is affected by rainfall.
Within the heavy rain, which could get the floodings, snails environments are affected by the flood.
as evidence shows, that rainfall is positive with schistosomiasis, so the risk of  schistosomiasis can be predicted by the rainfall.

For this project, mainly focus on ggplot with mapping, setting the rainfall into different groups and
changed into raster, then, adding two rasters into one map through ggplot2.

1.Shapefile data(snail.RData;CHNshp.RData)

2.Rmd code to creat the HTML(PublishFlood.Rmd)

3.Source code to plot(Auto-plot.R)
